This is Version 1.6 of CSVfix
Released 30-Apr-2014

Please note:

CSVfix is intended to be run from a command line prompt. To do this 
you will either need to specify the full path name of the executable on 
the command line, or add the path to your PATH environment variable.

Under Windows, you can do this using the System|Advanced|Environment 
Variables option of the Windows control panel. The CSVfix Windows installer 
does not alter your path or any other registry settings.
